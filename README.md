# Purpose of project
- This project is a web application which allows users to track and manage their tasks.  
- Task Tracker helps users to add, update, delete tasks, and toggle reminders for their tasks.  
- It will help users to track and complete their tasks successfully without having to worry about omitting or forgetting an important task.

# Usage
- Once the task tracker is running on the browser, click the add button to create tasks.  
- A modal will pop up for users to type in their task's details and create it.  
- Details of a task includes:  
    - Title  
    - Description  
    - Due date  
- When a user creates tasks, they will be displayed on the browser and sorted by time created, starting from the last task created. User can update tasks or delete them.   
- Users can click the update button on each task to update it. A modal will pop up for users to be able to update the task's details.
